\item{x, file, append, quote, sep, eol, na, dec}{See \code{\link[utils]{write.table}}}

}
\description{
Bugfix for the standard utils::write.table-function, copied from the standard-function and adapted.
When using nested data.frames and quote=TRUE, the original function first looks
at which "columns" are character of factor, and marks these for quoting, then flattens the structure to a matrix.
This functions also inspects columns that are data.frames or comparable. See the example for the difference.

\examples{
df <- data.frame(a='One;Two;Three',
                 b=I(data.frame(c="OtherVal",
                 d='Four;Five;Six',
                 e=4)))
\dontshow{environment(write.table) <- environment(utils::write.table)}
write.table(df, "~/../Desktop/Tempfile.csv", quote = TRUE, col.names = NA,
            sep = ";", dec = ",", qmethod = "double")
# This fails for utils::write.table, because Four;Five;Six is unquoted, rendering the csv useless
